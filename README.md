ðŸš€ Just built a simple JavaScript quiz app! ðŸ’¡

Here's a clean implementation of a multiple-choice quiz using vanilla JavaScript. The code features:

Dynamic question loading

Score tracking

Responsive feedback

This is a great example for beginners looking to understand:
âœ” DOM manipulation
âœ” Event handling
âœ” Array iteration
âœ” Basic program flow

Check out the code below! Would love to hear how others might enhance this - maybe add a timer, question shuffling, or localStorage for high scores?
